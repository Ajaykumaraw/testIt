                <p style="text-align: justify;padding: .2rem; font-size: small;">There are several components to history restarting for the biggest technology 
                    companies. First, there's the fact that they ran into their first serious recession: 
                    so far, all of the big tech companies other than Apple
                </p>
                <p  style="text-align: justify;padding: .2rem; font-size: small;">Americans by now are very used to our own fossil fuel companies doing 
                    everything they can to block the transition to solar and wind. We’ve basically 
                    accepted that this is a political-economic problem that we have to overcome if 
                    we’re going to both fight climate change and invest in cheap new energy 
                    sources. But China hasn’t yet realized this, and it’s a big problem — especially 
                    for China, but also for the entire world.

                    Fed vice chair for supervision Michael Barr released

                    management's job to fix the problems. But then, an addendum: It's the Fed's job

                        with this bank should have been clear, particularly for the Federal Reserve. 
                        They should not act surprised that it happened."

                        Patricia McCoy, a Boston College Law professor, tells me via email that the 
                        Fed had a "light regulation" policy for mid-sized banks, and asks: “Does the 
                        supervision/enforcement system need to be reformed to speed up 
                        enforcement and make it mandatory in certain circumstances rather than at 
                        the agency's discretion?"

                    stymied by entrenched local interests who exploit a thicket of veto points to 
                    preserve the built environment of the 1970s.”
